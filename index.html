        <h1>Frozen vs Tangled</h1>
        
        <p>Do Anna and Elsa look like Rapunzel? Is Frozen just “Tangled on Ice”?</p>

        <h2>Character Models</h2>
        
        <p>Disney has a distinguishable style for their female animated characters: big eyes, thin lips, and a small nose. It seems like Ariel from The Little Mermaid started this “Disney look,” and it has continued since then.  The most notable comparison here is Rapunzel and Anna.  They both have those Disney facial features that are typical of a Disney Princess.  Do they look similar? Sure.  But they also look different enough that you can tell that it’s a different character. For instance, Anna’s eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, and her face is generally rounder. Rapunzel, on the other hand, has a more pointed chin, bigger and more rounded eyes, and a more pronounced nose. There are also smaller details that differentiate the two characters.  Anna has more freckles than Rapunzel, and even has them on her shoulders.  Granted, we never saw Rapunzel’s shoulders, but the point is still there.  You can also notice Anna’s eyebrows wrinkling when they move, most notably in the “Party Is Over” clip. She also has prevalent neck muscles that appear when they speak. I never saw these details on the character models in Tangled.  For the most part, Rapunzel’s skin looked a little plastic and unrealistic; it’s only when you get a real close-up that you can see some of the finer details like freckles. There’s no need for close-ups to see the details on Anna’s character model, even just judging by a minute-long clip. </p>
    
        <h2>Art Direction</h2>
        
        <p>The world of Frozen differs greatly from Tangled, with its mountainous surroundings contrasting with the hilly environment of the 2010 film.  The color scheme of Frozen is also different–from the cool blue hues of the snow and ice versus Tangled’s warm and lush, green landscape.  Anna’s deep fuchsia cape is accented by decorative tulips on her dress, which varies in color greatly from Rapunzel’s pink/purple dress, lightly accented with decorative swirls and stripes.
Overall, I would say the animation is quite similar in style to Tangled.  Perhaps this was done purposely to make the film appear recognizable, so viewers could see a trailer and instantly know that it was a Disney film. Similar to how Disney’s princesses all have that certain look to them, Disney’s animated fairy tales of the <strong>90s </strong>all had a recognizable animation style (that others tried to replicate, e.g., Anastasia).  Disney could be attempting something similar with their CG fairy tales — make them look similar to evoke that <em>Disney</em> feeling in their viewers.</p>
